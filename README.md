This project is an informational website dedicated to the IT Department of Turiba University. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site provides a structured overview of the department, its academic programs, teaching staff, and ongoing or completed student projects.
The website features a clean and modern UI, responsive design for mobile users, and smooth navigation between sections. It serves both as an informative portal for prospective students and a showcase of the departmentâ€™s academic activity.
